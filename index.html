            <h3>Why this program?</h3>
            <p>
              It has been discovered that of all the waste we create globally, only 10% of it gets recycled; the remaining 90% of it ends up getting burnt, in landfills, or in our oceans. This in itself is a global pandemic resulting in environmental pollution, climate change, among others. 
              Very few countries have been able to solve the waste crisis in their locality; Sweden is a powerhouse in the recycling value chain with them being able to recycle over 90% of all the waste they create. They have built a strong waste management system to the point that they even have to import waste to keep the system running. <br> This however is an isolated experience because in Nigeria and other countries of Africa, waste management is a serious crisis resulting in dirty and unhealthy spaces.
              With the Waste Bank, we are committed to making the experience of Sweden the story in other parts of the world, but starting from Africa—specifically, Port Harcourt, Nigeria. We are constantly studying systems and environmental differences with the goal of proffering precise solutions to this pandemic. <br> We believe in a cleaner, greener tomorrow in which we have zero waste and we are working with this belief in a sustainable fashion.
              With the Waste Bank, we are introducing the concept of baking into waste management: a financial system powered by waste, where individuals and institutions get to save their waste the same way they save money with a financial institution.  <br>
              We are designing a community-focused system; in that the Waste Bank in a particular community will be set up and operated in relation to the circumstances of that community. Our focus is building a system that ensures every community we get into adopts our values and integrates proper waste management and recycling as a culture.
